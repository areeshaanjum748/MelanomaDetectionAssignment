## General Information

- This project focuses on detecting melanoma, a dangerous type of skin cancer, using deep learning techniques.
- The goal is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying skin lesion images as melanoma or benign.
- The dataset used in this project consists of dermoscopic images obtained from publicly available medical repositories.
- The project aims to aid dermatologists in early detection, improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning.

## Conclusions

- The model achieves high accuracy in melanoma classification.
- Data augmentation and preprocessing techniques significantly improve model performance.
- Transfer learning with pre-trained CNN models yields better results compared to training from scratch.
- Further improvements can be made by incorporating additional datasets and fine-tuning hyperparameters.

## Technologies Used

- Python - 3.x
- TensorFlow - 2.x
- Keras - 2.x
- OpenCV - 4.x
- NumPy - latest version
- Pandas - latest version
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
